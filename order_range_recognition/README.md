## Key Value Proposition

**This framework identifies continuous payment amount ranges with the highest order density without gaps or holes, providing statistically optimal intervals for representative sampling and statistical analysis.**

The system automatically discovers **contiguous transaction ranges** where orders are consistently present, eliminating the need for arbitrary thresholds. These gap-free intervals serve as ideal candidates for:

- **Representative Sampling**: Extract statistically valid subsets from continuous order distributions
- **A/B Testing**: Define test populations within naturally occurring transaction boundaries  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform robust analysis on homogeneous payment amount segments
- **Business Intelligence**: Focus analytics on transaction ranges with consistent merchant activity

## Core Statistical Principle

**The fundamental concept behind this analytical framework is based on Bayesian optimal histogram binning applied to two distinct but complementary payment analysis domains:**

### Dual Analysis Approach

This framework implements **two specialized analytical modules** that address different strategic business questions:

1. **Acceptance Rate (AR) Analysis** - `ia_AR_order_amount_range_of_interest.sql`
2. **Effective Cost Rate (ECR) Analysis** - `ia_ECR_order_amount_range_of_interest.sql`

Both modules share the same **Knuth Bayesian methodology** but analyze different aspects of payment processing:

- **AR Module**: Analyzes **declined/rejected orders** to identify payment amount ranges with highest rejection frequency
- **ECR Module**: Analyzes **approved orders** to identify payment amount ranges with highest processing cost concentration

### Unified Statistical Foundation

The Knuth Bayesian method provides a **mathematically principled approach to find the optimal number of bins** that balances model complexity against data fit. By maximizing Bayesian evidence, we automatically discover the natural structure in payment distributions without arbitrary parameter choices.

The analytical process follows these principles:

1. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Handle extreme right-skew in payment amounts through log-scale analysis
2. **Bayesian Optimization**: Find optimal bin count M* that maximizes marginal likelihood
3. **Frequency-weighted Filtering**: Focus on bins contributing to 90% of target metric (rejections or costs)
4. **Two-stage Refinement**: Apply Bayesian optimization twice for robust interval identification
5. **Strategic Categorization**: Generate LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL intervals for different business approaches

**This sophisticated statistical approach transforms continuous payment amount data into actionable strategic intervals, enabling targeted optimization based on transaction patterns.**

## Overview

The Order Amount Range Analysis framework implements an advanced Bayesian statistical methodology through **two complementary analytical modules**:

### Module 1: Acceptance Rate (AR) Analysis
**File**: `ia_AR_order_amount_range_of_interest.sql`

**Purpose**: Identifies payment amount ranges with the highest concentration of **declined/rejected orders** to understand where payment failures occur most frequently.

**Business Applications**:
- Risk assessment and fraud prevention strategy
- Payment method optimization for specific amount ranges
- Merchant onboarding guidelines based on transaction patterns
- Dynamic routing strategies to improve acceptance rates

### Module 2: Effective Cost Rate (ECR) Analysis
**File**: `ia_ECR_order_amount_range_of_interest.sql`

**Purpose**: Identifies payment amount ranges with the highest concentration of **processing costs** to optimize cost efficiency across transaction values.

**Business Applications**:
- Cost optimization and fee structure analysis
- Processor selection strategies by amount range
- Pricing model development for different transaction sizes
- Strategic cost reduction targeting

### Unified Output Structure

Both modules produce consistent output formats with three strategic interval types:
- **LARGE**: Full range covering 90% of target metric
- **MEDIUM**: Range covering up to 80% cumulative concentration
- **SMALL**: Single highest-frequency/highest-impact bin

This enables payment strategists to identify precise transaction value ranges where optimization efforts will have the greatest impact on either **acceptance rates** or **cost efficiency**.

- Computational efficiency through pre-aggregation techniques

### Analytical Framework Architecture

#### 1. Data Preparation

**AR Module (Rejection Analysis)**:
- Uses 6 months of order data from `VW_ATHENA_ORDER_` and `VW_ATHENA_ACCEPTANCE_RATE_PROCESSOR_`
- Extracts order details, payment amounts, and rejection reasons
- Filters to declined orders (`ORDER_STATUS = 'DECLINED'`)
- Includes payment error categories and processor information
- Adds recency flags for trend analysis

**ECR Module (Cost Analysis)**:
- Uses 6 months of approved order data from `VW_ATHENA_ORDER_` and `VW_ATHENA_PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_FEE`

- Computes `ORDER_EFFECTIVE_COST_RATE = ORDER_PROCESSOR_FEE_USD / TOTAL_GLOBAL_GMV`

#### 2. Logarithmic Transformation

**Both modules** apply identical logarithmic transformation to handle the extreme right skew typical in payment amounts:

$$y = \ln(\text{PaymentAmountUSD})$$

This transformation:
- **Stabilizes variance** across the payment amount range
- **Enables meaningful analysis** of both small and large transactions
- **Converts multiplicative relationships** into additive ones
- **Improves Bayesian convergence** for optimal bin detection

**AR Module Application**: Applied to declined order amounts for rejection pattern analysis
**ECR Module Application**: Applied to approved order amounts for cost pattern analysis

#### 3. Bayesian Binning Algorithm

**Both modules** use the identical Knuth Bayesian method to identify optimal bin count by maximizing:

$$\displaystyle F(M) = N \ln(M) + \ln \Gamma\left(\frac{M}{2}\right) - M \ln \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \ln \Gamma\left(\frac{N+M}{2}\right) + \sum_{k=1}^{M} \ln \Gamma\left(n_k + \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

Where:
- $M$ is the number of bins to evaluate (range: 64 to 4,096)
- $N$ is the total sample size (declined orders for AR, approved orders for ECR)
- $n_k$ is the count of observations in bin $k$
- $\Gamma$ is the gamma function (approximated using Stirling's method)

**AR Module**: Optimizes bins based on **rejection frequency** distribution
**ECR Module**: Optimizes bins based on **cost concentration** distribution

#### 4. Computational Optimization

**Both modules implement identical efficient two-level aggregation strategy:**

1. **First-level aggregation** (One-time cost O(N)):
   - Creates 20,000 micro-bins on the logarithmic scale
   - **AR Module**: Pre-aggregates declined order counts per micro-bin
   - **ECR Module**: Pre-aggregates approved order counts per micro-bin

2. **Second-level aggregation** (Geometric grid search):
   - Evaluates M candidates from 64 to 4,096 using geometric progression (step = 1.03)
   - Maps micro-bins to macro-bins using formula: $k = \lfloor u \times M / U \rfloor$
   - **AR Module**: Aggregates rejection frequencies for each M candidate
   - **ECR Module**: Aggregates cost concentrations for each M candidate

3. **Bayesian Score Calculation**:
   - Computes F(M) score for each candidate using Stirling's approximation
   - Selects optimal M* = argmax F(M) for both rejection and cost analysis
   - Avoids repeated data scans through pre-aggregation efficiency

#### 5. Two-Stage Filtering Process

**Stage 1: Logarithmic Scale Analysis** (Applied to both modules)
- Applies Knuth method on log-transformed payment amounts
- **AR Module**: Identifies bins containing 90% of total rejection frequency
- **ECR Module**: Identifies bins containing 90% of total ECR concentration
- Filters out extreme outliers and rare payment amounts

**Stage 2: Linear Scale Refinement** (Applied to both modules)
- Re-applies Knuth method on filtered data using linear USD scale
- **AR Module**: Focuses on core 90% of rejection-generating transactions
- **ECR Module**: Focuses on core 90% of cost-generating transactions
- Produces final strategic intervals with ~81% data coverage (90% Ã— 90%)

#### 6. Strategic Interval Generation

**Both modules** produce three complementary interval types with domain-specific interpretations:

**LARGE Interval**: Complete range covering 90% of target metric
- **AR Module Purpose**: Comprehensive acceptance rate optimization strategy
- **ECR Module Purpose**: Comprehensive cost optimization strategy
- **Coverage**: Full scope of significant transactions
- **Use Case**: Overall optimization initiatives

- **Use Case**: Quick wins and proof-of-concept initiatives

## Mathematical Foundation

### Knuth Bayesian Method Details

The Knuth method solves the fundamental problem of optimal histogram binning by treating it as a Bayesian model selection problem. **Both AR and ECR modules** use identical mathematical foundations but apply them to different datasets:

- **AR Module**: Evaluates bin configurations for declined order frequency distributions
- **ECR Module**: Evaluates bin configurations for processing cost distributions

### Stirling's Approximation Implementation

For computational efficiency with large datasets, both modules use identical gamma function approximation:

$$\ln \Gamma(x) \approx (x-0.5) \ln x - x + 0.5 \ln(2\pi) + \frac{1}{12x} - \frac{1}{360x^3}$$

This approximation provides sufficient accuracy for the M range [64, 4096] while maintaining computational efficiency in SQL.

### Pre-aggregation Strategy

**Both modules** implement identical two-level aggregation approach:

1. **Micro-bin Creation**: $u = \lfloor \frac{\ln(\text{amount}) - y_{\min}}{(y_{\max} - y_{\min}) / U} \rfloor$
2. **Macro-bin Mapping**: $k = \lfloor \frac{u \times M}{U} \rfloor$

Where U = 20,000 micro-bins provide sufficient resolution for accurate re-binning across both rejection and cost analysis.
